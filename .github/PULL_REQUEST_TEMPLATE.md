#### Are you implementing a new feature?

Requests for new features should first be discussed on the [developer forum](https://github.com/passport/develop).
This allows the community to gather feedback and assess whether or not there is
an existing way to achieve the desired functionality.

If it is determined that a new feature needs to be implemented, include a link
to the relevant discussion along with the pull request.

#### Is this a security patch?

Do not open pull requests that might have security implications.  Potential
security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to jaredhanson@gmail.com.
Once any vulerabilities have been repaired, the details will be disclosed
publicly in a responsible manner.  This also allows time for coordinating with
affected parties in order to mitigate negative consequences.

a pull request.  Delete this paragraph and the text above, and fill in the
